# Graph Temporal Data Warehouse (GTDW)

GTDW approach is an extension of classical multidimensional modelling based on the \textit{fact, measure, dimension, level and hierarchy} concepts. This extension consists of the introduction of the temporal concept in aggregation relationships due to the changes in the dimensions. The graph formalisation and the graph-oriented database implementation were adopted to overcome the constraints generated by the use of an ER model. This model separates the business concepts from the descriptors (attributes) to allow the independent evolution of each entity. Facts, dimensions and hierarchy levels are represented by nodes corresponding to the basic multidimensional concepts to which other nodes representing descriptors are linked. A temporal label consisting of a valid_time (VT) and a transaction_time (TT) has been assigned to all entities to allow the identification of the different instances. Additionally, the From_Date (FT) and To_Date (TD) labels determine the lifespans of the relationships in the dimensions

According to the GTDW approach, we chose to perform the instantiation process on Neo4j using the SSB data while generating several temporal changes in the aggregation relationships of some hierarchical levels and attributes; temporal queries were then applied to this temporal DW. Note that in the initial SSB schema, there were no hierarchical levels; we generated them from the attributes, as shown in

As a reminder, the Star Schema Benchmark, or SSB, was designed to evaluate the performance of database systems for star schema data warehouse queries. The SSB schema is based on the [TPC-H benchmark] (http://www.tpc.org/tpch/), but in a modified form with LINEORDER as a central fact table and dimension tables for customer, part, supplier, and date. The queries are also based on the TPC-H queries, but the number of queries is reduced to 13 and have been chosen to cover as much of the SSB as possible, so that potential users can derive a performance evaluation of the weighted subset they expect to use in practice. They are divided into 4 subgroups according to the difficulty and the number of domensions involved. The idea is that the total number of fact table rows retrieved will be determined by the selectivity (i.e., total Filter Factor FF) of restrictions on dimensions. More details in [Paper Download](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/StarSchemaB.PDF)


As the SSB data span from 1992 to 1998, the following changes in relationships were made:

(1) For the dimension Customer, one hundred randomly selected customers have changed their assignment on the hierarchical levels  C_City, C_Nation and C_Region. Thus, these clients are assigned to two different levels according to the two time intervals T1 = [FD1 = 01/01/1992, TD1 = 01/01/1994] and T1 = [FD1 = 01/01/1994, TD1 = 31/12/9999]. 

(2) For the dimension Supplier, one hundred randomly selected suppliers have changed their assignment on the hierarchical levels C_City, C_Nation and C_Region. Thus, these suppliers are assigned to two different levels according to the two time intervals T2 = [FD2 = 01/01/1992, TD2 = 01/01/1996] and T2 = [FD2 = 01/01/1996, TD2 = 31/12/9999].

(3) For the dimension \textsc{Part}, the \textsc{Size} attributes of one hundred randomly selected products were changed . Thus, these products had two different sizes; they had one size for the time interval $T_{3}$ = [$FD_{3}$ = 01/01/1992, $TD_{3}$ = 01/01/1995] and another size for the time interval $T_{3}$$'$ = [$FD_{3}$ = 01/01/1995, $TD_{3}$ = 31/12/9999]

It should be noted that the validity period of the versions may correspond to the effective validity period of the data as well as being different for dealing with earlier data as in this case.  

We were able to apply the 13 queries proposed on SSB which we took up in CRL either explicitly to query a particular version or implicitly to query all versions according to the existing schema. Some queries were readjusted to match the time intervals established during the versioning. Note that some queries has been adjusted to match the different schema versions.

## 1. Platform, data and installation. 

To install the GAMM with SSB data, use the graph database Neo4j version 4.x.x or higher. The data to be downloaded from [Download](https://github.com/Redwass/GAMM/tree/main/data) is in the CSV's files. The configuration and installation commands on Windows and Linux platforms are as follows:

### 1.3 Create database
After the database is set up using the neo4j-admin command, it must be created manually on :

#### Command line
CREATE DATABASE gammssb (on system database)

#### Neo4j desktop 
on the <<+Create database>> tab with the name gammssb.

### 1.4 Create indexes
This is not required, but you can create the following indexes to optimise query execution :

create index index_part_category for (p:part) on (p.P_CATEGORY);

create index index_part_brand for (p:part) on (p.P_BRAND);

create index idxex_customer_region for (c:customer) on (c.C_REGION);

create index idxex_customer_nation for (c:customer) on (c.C_NATION);

create index idxex_customer_city for (c:customer) on (c.C_CITY);

## 2. Queries

Here are the 13 SSB queries using the Cypher Language Request (CLR) and some extra queries to explain explicit and implicit requests in GAMM. They can be applied on Cypher-shell or in Neo4j Browser.

GAMM offers a great flexibility in the elaboration of explicit and implicit queries which we detail through the following examples. The queries are written in Cypher Language Request CLR specific to the Neo4j graph database :

(1) Explicit requests. Allow to extract data from a specific version or set of versions based on the time parameter TT using the clause **where 𝑆𝑇𝑛 <=TT<𝐸𝑇𝑛** with 𝑇𝑛 =[𝑆𝑇𝑛 ,𝐸𝑇𝑛 ] is the period of validity of version 𝑉𝑛. 

Example 1 :
```cypher
match (d:date)<-[:order_date]-(l:lineorder)-[r:order_part]->(p:part) 
where 𝑆𝑇2 <= l.TT < 𝑆𝑇2 
return d.d_year, count(distinct(p.partkey)), sum(l.lo_revenue) 
order by d.d_year
```
Note that in the CRL, the clause : **return 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 1,.., 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 N , aggregate_function(attribute)** allows for grouping aggregation by 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 1... 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 N.

(2) Implicit requests: Allows the browsing of all instances related to the entities specified in the query without version restriction. This feature, which is due to the ability of graph databases to traverse instances through the relationships between entities, offers a big advantage in formulating cross-queries using the same simple queries whatever the number of versions. 

Example 2 :
```cypher
match (d:date)<-[:order_date]-(l:lineorder)-[r:order_part]->(p:part) 
return d.d_year, count(distinct(p.partkey)), sum(l.lo_revenue) 
order by d.d_year
```
The results of the queries presented in the examples are shown as follows :

![Cover](https://github.com/Redwass/GAMM/blob/main/figures/queries_results.JPG)

Explicit query in example 1 displays the slaes_amount per year and the number of pieces. According to TT parameter, the result is obtained only on version 2 although the dimension part has instances in all 3 versions.

In the other side, implicit query in example 2 witch is same like query 1 with out TT parameter show the result in all 3 versions as the dimension  part exists in all these 3 versions of the scheme.

We present below an implicit and explicit version of each of the 13 proposed queries on SSB set up in CLR. Some queries have been readjusted to match the time intervals established during versioning or the schema of version. For example, the first query in SSB was adjusted by changing the D_YEAR attribute to 1997 instead of 1994 in SSB to match the versioning we established because the Quantity measure was created only from the 3rd version of the schema and using data from the years 1997 and 1998.

##### Q1.1
